# [Build Awesome Command-Line Applications in Ruby](http://pragprog.com/book/dccar)
&mdash; [TL;DR](http://awesome-cli-ruby.heroku.com/)
> There are developers who demand polish and usability from their command-line tools,  
> and there are developers who are interested in delivering it!

## Backing Up Data 
*[simple]*

Save a backup of the state of each database

 - after every single *day* of the current iteration,
 - at the end of every *iteration*. 

So, if we're on the fifth day of our third iteration, we want to be able to access a backup for iterations 1 and 2, as well as backups for the first four days of the third iteration.

## Managing Tasks 
*[command suite]*

Ability to *create*, *list*, and *complete* tasks in order. 

That way, any time we come back to our computer, we can easily see how much progress we've made and what's next to do.
